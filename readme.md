Description
===========

This repository is to become a set of basic image processing filters for GNU 
Octave. Octave currently is missing a number of filters that Matlab has implemented.
To increase GNU Octave compatibility with Matlab, these functions are being written
from scratch, using Matlab's specified inputs and outputs as a guide.

These .m files are expected to be compatible with Octave 3.8.x and higher. I have no
plans to backport these to earlier versions.

Installation
------------

Download and run from the current directory in Octave.
